% appendix: How to create a backup

The create backup action is used to copy a given movie to a backup device on a Globus
endpoint. The action is initiated by clicking the ``Create Backup'' button available
in the backups pop-up window where the user selects an endpoint and backup device
upon which to create a backup.

When the ``Create Backup'' action is initiated, two lists should be created to populate
the dropdown menus in the pop-up window. The first list should contain all endpoints
which have been used before. If the user has not used any endpoints before, the list
should be empty. The second list should contain all backup devices available on the
selected endpoint. The frontend will use the Globus Transfer API to 
\href{appendix:identifybackupdevices}{identify all backup devices} available on the 
user-selected endpoint.
