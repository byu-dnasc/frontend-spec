% appendix: list collections

\section{List Collections}

There are multiple instances in the frontend where the user must select a collection.
This appendix will describe the logic for getting a list of collections.

The \linkglobusgetendpointbyid{get endpoint by id} API is not sufficient 
for the purposes of this app because GCP endpoints cannot give the app client 
a role. The list of collections returned by this API is limited to those collections 
in which the user has a role of administrator or access\_manager.

Another \linkglobusendpointsearch{API} exists for searching collections. It even
supports scoping the search to only a subset of endpoints that the user has
some kind of association with.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The main DNASC collection
    \item GCP endpoints used by the DNASC for uploading and downloading data
    in the lab
