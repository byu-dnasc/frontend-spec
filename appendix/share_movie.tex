% appendix: how to s


To accomplish this, post an access rule object to \texttt{/endpoint/endpoint\_xid/access}. The access rule 
needs to include the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{user.globus\_id}
    \item \texttt{movie.sample\_name}
\end{itemize}

This rule will grant the user access to the primary movie data. From there, the backend will 
create additional access rules so that the user can access any analyses associated with the 
movie.

\emph{Will the user receive an automated message from Globus?}
