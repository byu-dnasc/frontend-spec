% Appendix: Backup Device Registration

There is a dedicated pop-up window for registering backup devices. It functions
to collection information from the user about a storage device and its location,
validate the information, place a ``cookie'' on the backup device to identify it 
for future transfers, and add a record of the device to the database.

\subsubsection{Step 1: identify backup device}

Once the path of the device on the endpoint is determined, a ``cookie'' 
should be created and placed on the backup device via Globus Transfer. This cookie 
should consist of an empty file with a unique name. In the event of a download, this 
cookie will be used to identify the backup device.

Upon successful registration, the user-provided name for the backup device and the 
filename of the cookie should be stored in the database. The device names will be 
used to populate a dropdown menu in the ``Create Backup'' pop-up window for the
user to select the backup device to use for the transfer.

Backup device data should be stored in a database on the website backend, not in
the Globus Search index.
