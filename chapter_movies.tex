\section{Summary}
The Movies page has the most functionality and most complex functionality. Also, 
to avoid any confusion, there's nothing film-related here. A ``movie'' is the 
sequencing which has taken place on a single stage within a sequencing run. Up 
to four independent stages make up a ``run''. Now that that's out of the wayâ€¦.

\section{Table}
Each row in the movie table will have a column for each of the following properties 
belonging to the movie object. Rows of movie data should be sorted by date. The 
cells of some columns serve as buttons to open a pop-up window.
