\section{Overview}

The current users page will be adapted to help technicians share data with 
external DNASC users.

The current website facilitates the provision of services to internal users by
maintaining user accounts. This feature can be adapted to provide technicians
with a database of the Globus usernames of DNASC users. This new resource will 
be used to facilitate the sharing of data with DNASC users.

\section{Table}

The current table only needs to be modified to include a ``Globus Id'' field.

\section{Actions}

On the current site, the only way to add a new user is for the user to register
themselves using their BYU login. This is not a viable option for external users,
so new actions need to be added to allow technicians to add and edit external users.

\subsection{New External User}

The current page needs to be modified to include a ``New External User'' button to
prompt a pop-up window to collect the necessary information. This pop-up window
could be similar to the existing user registration page, but with the following
changes:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt
    \item The ``Net ID'' field should not be collected. The field could be populated 
    with some default value when displayed (like ``n/a'').
    \item The field ``Department'' should also not be collected. This field could be
    populated with some default value when displayed (like ``n/a'').
    \item The value of the ``Role'' field should be automatically populated with 
    ``External''.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Edit user}

The edit user action is already implemented. However, it is currently only available
to the user who is to be edited. This action needs to be made available to all 
technicians and system admins for all external users. Additionally, the edit user
pop-up should include a new button to allow technicians to delete external users.

\section{Future improvement}
The current user registration system is integrated with BYU's central 
authentication system (CAS). This means that external users are currently not 
able to create accounts. However, this could be a useful feature in the future 
if it became desirable for external users to create their own account. For now, 
though, it seems that requiring external users to register themselves with the 
DNASC via the website would too tedious for the mere purpose of collecting their
globus username.
