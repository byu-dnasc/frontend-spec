\section{Summary}

The current users page will be adapted to help technicians share data with 
external DNASC users.

The current website facilitates the provision of services to internal users by
maintaining user accounts. This feature can be adapted to provide technicians
with a database of the Globus usernames of DNASC users. This database can be
used to facilitate the sharing of data with DNASC users.

\subsection{Discussion, future improvement}
The current user registration system is integrated with BYU's central 
authentication system (CAS). This means that external users are currently not 
able to create accounts. However, this could be a useful feature in the future 
if it became desirable for external users to create their own account. For now, 
though, it seems that requiring external users to register themselves with the 
DNASC via the website would too tedious for the mere purpose of collecting their
globus username.

\section{Table}

Each row in the users table will have a column for each of the following 
properties belonging to the user object. Notice that not all user properties 
are included. Rows of user data should be sorted by date of latest movie. 
The cells of some columns serve as buttons to open a pop-up window.

\begin{table}[h]
    \input{table/user_table_details.tex}
    \caption{Users table}
\end{table}

\section{Pop-up windows}

\subsection{Movies shared with \texttt{user\_name}}

Show all movies submitted by \texttt{user\_name}.

\subsection{Movie details}

A small pop-up to view all fields belonging to a movie.

\section{Actions}

\subsection{Create new user}

When this action is initiated, a pop-up opens to collect several user 
properties from the website user (user\_name, user\_email, globus\_id). 
The data collected from the user must be validated. 

\subsection{Delete user}

Delete a given user.

\subsection{Edit user}
