An essential task for DNASC technicians is to copy primary data files from 
ORC storage to a hard drive which serves as a backup. Once a backup is created,
the files can be removed from ORC storage to free up space. 

The function of the Backup Devices page is to allow a user to register a 
new backup device. 


\noindent The backup devices page allows a user to register a new backup device.
In the case of a device with no data yet, registration involves:
\begin{itemize}
    \item identifying the device on a Globus endpoint
    \item creating a cookie
    \item putting the cookie on the device
\end{itemize}

\noindent In the case of a device with data, registration involves:
\begin{itemize}
    \item upload device cookie to GCS v5 endpoint
    \item HTTP download of cookie into browser
    \item Read in storage records from cookie to
