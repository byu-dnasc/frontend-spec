A new page will be created to facilitate the backing up of sequencing data 
files generated in the DNASC. These files are initially stored on systems 
administered by the Office of Research Computing (ORC). An essential task 
for DNASC technicians is to copy primary data files from ORC storage to local 
hard drives. Once backed up, the files can be removed from ORC storage to 
free up space.

\section{Components}

The backups page will consist of a table of movies and a button to open a
pop-up window to collect information to register a new backup device. 

\subsection{Table: ``Awaiting Backup''}

A table on the backups page will display movies that have not yet been backed
up, sorted by the date the movie was created. Only the following fields should 
be displayed:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt
    \item Movie name
    \item Movie creation date
    \item Movie size
    \item Backup device
    \item Backup status
\end{itemize}

\noindent Included in each row will be a button to initiate the backup process
for the respective movie.

\section{Actions}

\subsection{Register Backup Device}

The register backup device action is used to register a new backup device.

The registration of backup devices simplifies the transfer process in that the 
backup device object serves as an abstraction of the Globus endpoint and path 
which is the transfer destination (or source in the seldom case in which data on 
a backup device needs to be uploaded).

The user must provide the following info to register a backup device:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Backup device name
    \item Backup device endpoint id
\end{itemize}

\noindent \emph{Given the endpoint id, there should be some pre-built logic to send the user to
the app.globus.org to browse the endpoint (https://docs.globus.org/modern-research-data-portal/mrdp-description/).}
The path of the device on the endpoint needs to be determined, at which point
a "cookie" will be created and placed on the backup device. This cookie will
be used to identify the backup device in the future.

Upon successful registration, the backup device will be added to the list of
available backup devices. This list will be used to populate a dropdown menu
in the backup movie pop-up window.

Backup device data should be stored in a database on the website backend, not in
the Globus Search index.
