% Chapter: Register Backup Device Pop-up

\section{Overview}

This chapter will describe the contents of the register backup device pop-up 
window. This pop-up collects information from the user about a new backup device 
and registers it to be available for future backup transfers. It is opened by
clicking the ``register backup device'' button in the ``create backup'' subsection 
of the backups pop-up window. Once registered, the backup device should be available 
to be selected by the user as the destination for a backup transfer.

\section{Backup device registration}

The following three pieces of information are needed to identify and register a backup 
device:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt
    \item Globus Collection
    \item Path on the Globus Collection.
    \item Backup device name (arbitrary string provided by user)
\end{itemize}

\section{Contents}

The contents of the  register backup device pop-up window can be partitioned into three 
sections: ``Select Globus Collection'', ``Select Device Path'', and ``Backup Device Name''. 
The pop-up window should contain all three sections in the order listed above, including 
the section name (formatted as a title) and associated elements. The elements each 
respective section should contain are described below. At the bottom of the pop-up window
should be a button labeled ``Register Backup Device''.

\subsection{Select Globus collection section}

The following text should be displayed in the ``Select Globus Collection'' section:

\vspace{3mm}
``Select the Globus Collection the new backup device is accessible from.''
\vspace{3mm}

\noindent This section consists of two subsection which provide the user with two options for 
selecting a Globus collection (see below). Once a collection has been selected, the 
collection name should be displayed in a text box and the user should be given the 
opportunity to save this collection as a favorite for future use. Initially, the text 
box should display the string ``None selected''.

\subsubsection{Select a favorite collection}

This subsection consists of a dropdown menu of the user's favorite collections.

\subsubsection{Search for an collection}

This subsection consists of a search box. Each search result should include the collection 
name and the collection owner.

\subsection{Select device path section}

The following text should be displayed in the select device path section:

\vspace{3mm}
``Select the path on the Globus Collection to the new backup device.''
\vspace{3mm}

\noindent To select a path within the collection, the user should be redirected to the
globus web app to select a path within the collection. The select device path subsection 
should contain a button labeled ``Select Path on \texttt{collection\_name}'' to redirect 
the user. Before the actual redirect, a pop-up box should inform the user of the redirect
and allow the user to cancel or proceed. It may also be necessary to brief the user on the
purpose of the redirect. Once the user has returned to lsdnasc.byu.edu, the path should be 
displayed in a text box (if a path was selected). The initial value of this text box should 
be ``None selected''. If the callback from the Globus web app indicates that the user
didn't select a path, a pop-up box should inform the user that no path was selected.

\subsection{Name new backup device section}

The name new backup device section should consist of a text box in which the user can
input a name for the new backup device. The text box should be labeled ``Backup Device
Name''. As long as the name is unique, the backup device should be registered.

\subsection{Element availability}

\subsubsection{Select Path button}

Because the device path cannot be selected until the Globus collection has been selected,
the select path button should be disabled until a Globus collection has been selected. A 
message should be displayed near the button indicating that the button is disabled until 
a Globus collection has been selected.

\subsubsection{Register button}

The register button should be disabled until a Globus collection, path, and backup device
name have been selected.
