% Chapter: Register Backup Device Pop-up

\section{Overview}

This chapter will describe the contents of the register backup device pop-up 
window. This pop-up will facilitate the registration of a new backup device
for use in the DNASC. It is opened by clicking the ``Register Backup Device''
button in the ``Create Backup'' subsection of the backups pop-up window.
Once registered, the backup device will be available to be selected by the
user as the destination for a backup transfer.

\subsection{Movitation}
The registration of backup devices simplifies the transfer process in that the 
backup device object serves as an abstraction of the Globus endpoint and path 
which are the transfer destination (or, in the seldom case in which data on 
a backup device needs to be uploaded, the source).

\section{Contents}

The register backup device pop-up window is used to collect information from
the user to identify, validate and register a backup device. The following details 
must be obtained to register a backup device:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt
    \item Name (arbitrary string provided by user)
    \item Globus endpoint id
    \item Globus endpoint path. \emph{Given the endpoint id, there should be some pre-built logic to send the user to
app.globus.org to browse the endpoint and select a path (https://docs.globus.org/modern-research-data-portal/mrdp-description/).}
\end{itemize}
