% Chapter: Introduction

\section{Overview}

This is a specification for the frontend component of a new application which will
support the operations of the BYU DNA Sequencing Center (DNASC).

\subsection{DNASC website expansion}

The BYU DNA Sequencing Center provides state-of-the-art DNA sequencing services 
to internal and external users. Two essential tasks in supporting the provision of these 
services are the sharing and backing up of files generated in the center. The existing 
DNASC website \linklsdnasc{lsdnasc.byu.edu} will get a new page to facilitate these tasks.

\subsubsection{Movies page}
A new web page will be created containing a table, the rows of which representing sequencing 
datasets (called ``movies'') and associated data. Selecting an individual movie from the 
table opens a pop-up window which displays additional movie data, but also includes
buttons that initiate actions such as sharing or creating a backup for a movie. This page 
will be accessible from the toolbar on lsdnasc.byu.edu.

\subsubsection{Functionalities}
The frontend will allow users to browse, transfer and share data located in a storage system 
administered by BYU Office of Research Computing (ORC) using RESTful web APIs from 
Globus, a not-for-profit Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider.

\subsubsection{Databases}
The new functionality will draw on two sources for data: the current database running on the 
BYU Life Science IT web server, and a new database or \linkglobusindex{``search index''} 
hosted by Globus.

\subsubsection{Appearance}
In general, the new page should be similar in appearance to existing DNASC pages such as 
the ``Plate History'' page. This includes functions such as table filters and a search bar. 
% TODO: add screenshots as supplementary materials
These modified screenshots of the ``Plate History'' page demonstrate how each new page 
should look.

\section{Document organization and content}

The chapters of this document will describe of the appearance and purpose of each of the
elements associated with the new web page. Instructions for implementing the 
functionalities required by each element are provided as appendices to this document. 
Other appendices provide information on Globus APIs and concepts, data models, and more.
