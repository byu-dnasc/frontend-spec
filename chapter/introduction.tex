% Chapter: Introduction

\section{DNASC website expansion}

The BYU DNA Sequencing Center (DNASC) provides state-of-the-art DNA sequencing services 
to internal and external users. An essential part of the provision of these services is 
the sharing and backup of files generated in the center.

The DNASC website \linklsdnasc{lsdnasc.byu.edu} will get three new pages, accessible 
through links in a dropdown listing called ``Data''. Each page will consist mainly of 
tabular data which will include links to popup windows with additional data and actions. 
The Users and Drives tables will be populated with data collected from frontend users. 
The data in the Movies table will be maintained by a backend. All data will be read in 
from and written to a database (i.e. a Globus ``\linkglobusindex{index}'') using the 
\linkglobussearch{Globus Search web API}. The frontend will also have functionality 
to initiate downloading, uploading, and sharing of files located on a storage system 
administered by BYU Office of Research Computing (ORC) via the \linkglobustransfer{Globus Transfer web API}.

In general, the new pages can be templated after the existing DNASC pages such as the ``Plate History'' page. This 
includes functions such as table filters and a search bar.

These modified screenshots of the ``Plate History'' page 
demonstrate how each new page should look.

\section{Document organization and content}

The chapters of this document will describe of the appearance and purpose of each of the
new webpages. Instructions on how to implement the functionalities required by each page
are provided as appendices to this document. Other appendices provide information on
Globus APIs and concepts, data models, and more.
