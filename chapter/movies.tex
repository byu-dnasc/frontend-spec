% Chapter: Movies page

\section{Overview}

This chapter will describe the basic design of the Movies page, including the table and
table filters. Table rows represent movies and contain links to pop-up windows. The pop-ups 
mentioned in this chapter will be described in more detail in subsequent chapters.

\section{Movies Table}
The movie table will have a column for each of the following attributes of the movie object. 
Rows of movie data should be sorted by date. The cells of some columns serve as buttons to 
open pop-up windows.

\begin{table}[h]
    \input{table/movie_table_details.tex}
    \caption{Movies table}
\end{table}

\subsection{Pop-up Availability}

It is only possible to share or back up a movie if the movie is available in the DNASC Globus
collection. Therefore, if the movie is not available, the share and backup buttons should be
unavailable. Such movies have the value of \texttt{is\_online} set to ``False''.

\subsection{Field applicability}

Some fields are not applicable to movies which are no longer online (i.e. not available in the
DNASC Globus collection). For movies where this is the case, these fields should have a value
of ``n/a''.

\section{Table Filters}

The movies table should have filters to assist in browsing the data, however, more importantly,
the following filters should be implemented to assist with the essential DNASC tasks of sharing
and backing up movie files. These filters could be implemented as a checkbox that toggles the filter 
on and off.

\subsection{Awaiting Backup}

A filter should be provided to show only movies that have not been backed up to a backup device.
Such movies are identifiable by the fact that the value of \texttt{backup\_device} is ``None''. 

\subsection{Awaiting Sharing}

A filter should be provided to show only movies to which no DNASC user has access. Such movies 
fulfill two conditions:
\begin{enumerate}\itemsep1pt
    \item The user designated by \texttt{user\_name} is not internal (i.e. no netid), and:
    \item There is no access rule associated with the movie in question
\end{enumerate}
