% chapter: sharing

\section{Overview}

This chapter will describe the purpose and contents of the sharing pop-up window. This 
pop-up allows the user to share the given movie with a DNASC user. It also lists 
DNASC users who have access to the given movie and gives the website user the opportunity 
revoke a DNASC user's access. This pop-up window should be opened by clicking a cell in 
the ``users with access'' column of the movies table.

\section{Contents}

The sharing pop-up window should contain a listing of users who have access to the movie,
a search bar for selecting a registered DNASC user to share the movie with, a button to 
share the movie with the selected DNASC user.

\subsection{Users with access listing}

The sharing pop-up should contain a listing of DNASC users who have access to the movie.
This listing should also provide a way to select a user whose access should be revoked. 
The listing should contain the following fields:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt
    \item The name of the user
    \item The user's Globus ID
    \item The date the user was granted access
    \item A button to revoke access (optional depending on implementation)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Share movie button}

The sharing pop-up should contain a search bar for selecting a registered DNASC user 
who should receive access to the given movie. Once a user is selected, the movie is
shared with the selected user by pressing the share movie button. The share movie button 
should be disabled (but visible) until a user is selected. See appendix 
\ref{appendix:sharemovie} for implementation details.
