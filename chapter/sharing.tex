% chapter: sharing

\section{Overview}

This chapter will describe the contents and functions of the Sharing pop-up window. This 
pop-up window allows technicians to share a movie with a DNASC customer. The user is presented
with the list of users who have access to the movie, and is given the option to share the movie
with a new user. This pop-up window should be opened by clicking a cell in the 
``Users With Access'' column in the Movies table.

\section{Listing: Users With Access}

A listing of DNASC users who have access to the movie should be displayed. The listing should
also allow the user to select a DNASC user with whom the movie has been shared to revoke access.
The listing should contain the following fields:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt
    \item The name of the user
    \item The user's Globus ID
    \item The date the user was granted access
    \item A button to revoke access (optional depending on implementation)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation}

First, get an \hyperref[section:updatingcollectionaccessrules]{up-to-date list of access rules} 
to determine which users have access to this movie. Then, use this information to filter out the 
appropriate \texttt{user} records.

\section{Action: Share Movie}

The purpose of the share action is to grant a DNASC customer access to the given movie.
