% Chapter: Active Transfers

\section{Overview}

The simplest page, the Active Transfers page will show users all movies in the
process of being downloaded or uploaded. As soon as a transfer is successfully 
initiated using the movies page, the task will appear on the Active Transfers page 
as part of a listing of all active transfers. This will help the user keep track 
of the progress of active transfers, as well as give the user the opportunity to 
cancel any active transfer. 

The transfers page should be similar to the Activity page in the Globus web app, 
but simpler. In contrast to the Globus web app, only active transfers will be 
visible. Any successfully completed transfer can be identified by checking the 
Movies table for the ``Online'' status of the movie in question.

If a transfer fails, it can either be resubmitted, or the user can troubleshoot 
the failure by logging into the Globus web app.

\section{Task listing}

Tasks listed on the Active Transfers page originate from a Globus API. Refresh 
the list of tasks every 30 seconds.
