% chapter: movie details

\section{Overview}

This chapter will describe the contents of the Movie Details pop-up window. This pop-up
window allows technicians to browse information about a single movie. This pop-up window 
is opened by clicking on a movie ID in the Movies table.

\section{Movie details listing}

The movie details pop-up window should contain a listing of names and values attributes 
of the given movie. Some attributes are not applicable to movies which are no 
longer online (i.e. not available in the DNASC Globus collection). For attributes where
this is the case, the attribute should not be displayed. However, if the movie is online,
then all movie attributes should be displayed.
