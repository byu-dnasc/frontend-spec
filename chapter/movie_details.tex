% chapter: movie details

\section{Overview}

This chapter will describe the contents of the Movie Details pop-up window. This pop-up
window allows technicians to browse information about a single movie. This pop-up window 
is opened by clicking on a movie ID in the Movies table.

\section{Movie details listing}

The movie details pop-up window should contain a listing of properties (i.e. both 
names and values) of the given movie object. Not all properties are to be displayed
for all movies depending on whether or not the movie is online.

\subsubsection{Applicable properties}

Some properties are not applicable to movies 
which are no longer online (i.e. not available in the DNASC Globus collection). For properties
where this is the case, the property should not be displayed. However, if the movie is online,
then all movie properties should be displayed. The JSON definition of the movie object 
contains a flag \texttt{valid\_offline} to indicate whether a given property is applicable
to offline movies.
